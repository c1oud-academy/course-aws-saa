A company is setting up a cloud architecture for an international money transfer service to be deployed in AWS which will have thousands of users around the globe. The service should be available 24/7 to avoid any business disruption and should be resilient enough to handle the outage of an entire AWS region.

A company is using multiple AWS accounts that are consolidated using AWS Organizations. They want to copy several S3 objects to another S3 bucket that belonged to a different AWS account which they also own. The Solutions Architect was instructed to set up the necessary permissions for this task and to ensure that the destination account owns the copied objects and not the account it was sent from.
How can the Architect accomplish this requirement?
+A) Configure cross-account permissions in S3 by creating an IAM customer-managed policy that allows an IAM user or role to copy objects from the source bucket in one account to the destination bucket in the other account. Then attach the policy to the IAM user or role that you want to use to copy objects between accounts.
B) Enable the Requester Pays feature in the source S3 bucket. The fees would be waived through Consolidated Billing since both AWS accounts are part of AWS Organizations.
B) Connect the two S3 buckets from two different AWS accounts to Amazon WorkDocs. Set up cross-account access to integrate the two S3 buckets. Use the Amazon WorkDocs console to copy the objects from one account to the other with modified object ownership assigned to the destination account.
