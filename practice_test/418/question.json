    "text": "A leading e-commerce company is in need of a storage solution that can be simultaneously accessed by 1000 Linux servers in multiple availability zones. The servers are hosted in EC2 instances that use a hierarchical directory structure via the NFSv4 protocol. The service should be able to handle the rapidly changing data at scale while still maintaining high performance. It should also be highly durable and highly available whenever the servers will pull data from it, with little need for management.\nAs the Solutions Architect, which of the following services is the most cost-effective choice that you should use to meet the above requirement?"
