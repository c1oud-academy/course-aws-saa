    "text": "A company is planning to launch a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster in AWS that does Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The solution should scale-out their simulation jobs to experiment with more tunable parameters for faster and more accurate results. The cluster is composed of Windows servers hosted on t3a.medium EC2 instances. As the Solutions Architect, you should ensure that the architecture provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies.\nWhich is the MOST suitable and cost-effective solution that the Architect should implement to achieve the above requirements?"
