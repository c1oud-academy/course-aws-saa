    "text": "A fast food company is using AWS to host their online ordering system which uses an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances deployed across multiple Availability Zones with an Application Load Balancer in front. To better handle the incoming traffic from various digital devices, you are planning to implement a new routing system where requests which have a URL of <server>/api/android are forwarded to one specific target group named 'Android-Target-Group'. Conversely, requests which have a URL of <server>/api/ios are forwarded to another separate target group named 'iOS-Target-Group'.\nHow can you implement this change in AWS?",
