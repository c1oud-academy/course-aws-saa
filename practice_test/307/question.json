    "text": "A technical lead of the Cloud Infrastructure team was consulted by a software developer regarding the required AWS resources of the web application that he is building. The developer knows that an Instance Store only provides ephemeral storage where the data is automatically deleted when the instance is terminated. To ensure that the data of the web application persists, the app should be launched in an EC2 instance that has a durable, block-level storage volume attached. The developer knows that they need to use an EBS volume, but they are not sure what type they need to use.\nIn this scenario, which of the following is true about Amazon EBS volume types and their respective usage?",
