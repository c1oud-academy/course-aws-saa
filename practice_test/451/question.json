    "text": "A data analytics company keeps a massive volume of data that they store in their on-premises data center. To scale their storage systems, they are looking for cloud-backed storage volumes that they can mount using Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) devices from their on-premises application servers. They have an on-site data analytics application that frequently accesses the latest data subsets locally while the older data are rarely accessed. You are required to minimize the need to scale the on-premises storage infrastructure while still providing their web application with low-latency access to the data.\nWhich type of AWS Storage Gateway service will you use to meet the above requirements?"
