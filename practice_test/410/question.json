    "text": "A news company is planning to use a Hardware Security Module (CloudHSM) in AWS for secure key storage of their web applications. You have launched the CloudHSM cluster but after just a few hours, a support staff mistakenly attempted to log in as the administrator three times using an invalid password in the Hardware Security Module. This has caused the HSM to be zeroized, which means that the encryption keys on it have been wiped. Unfortunately, you did not have a copy of the keys stored anywhere else.\nHow can you obtain a new copy of the keys that you have stored on Hardware Security Module?"
