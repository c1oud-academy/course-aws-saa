    "text": "A company is setting up a cloud architecture for an international money transfer service to be deployed in AWS which will have thousands of users around the globe. The service should be available 24/7 to avoid any business disruption and should be resilient enough to handle the outage of an entire AWS region. To meet this requirement, the Solutions Architect has deployed their AWS resources to multiple AWS Regions. He needs to use Route 53 and configure it to set all of the resources to be available all the time as much as possible. When a resource becomes unavailable, Route 53 should detect that it's unhealthy and stop including it when responding to queries.\nWhich of the following is the most fault-tolerant routing configuration that the Solutions Architect should use in this scenario?",
