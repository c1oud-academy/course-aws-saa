You have a fleet of EC2 instances which retrieve messages from the SQS queue, process the file, and finally, send you and the user an email confirmation that the item has been successfully processed. Your officemate uploaded one test file to the S3 bucket and after a couple of hours, you noticed that you and your officemate have 50 emails from your application with the same message.\nWhich of the following is most likely the root cause why the application has sent you and the user multiple emails?",
