    "text": "A company has a hybrid cloud architecture that connects their on-premises data center and cloud infrastructure in AWS. They require a durable storage backup for their corporate documents stored on-premises and a local cache that provides low latency access to their recently accessed data to reduce data egress charges. The documents must be stored to and retrieved from AWS via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. These files must immediately be accessible within minutes for six months and archived for another decade to meet the data compliance.\nWhich of the following is the best and most cost-effective approach to implement in this scenario?",
