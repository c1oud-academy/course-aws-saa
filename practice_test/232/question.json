    "text": "The media company that you are working for has a video transcoding application running on Amazon EC2. Each EC2 instance polls a queue to find out which video should be transcoded, and then runs a transcoding process. If this process is interrupted, the video will be transcoded by another instance based on the queuing system. This application has a large backlog of videos which need to be transcoded. Your manager would like to reduce this backlog by adding more EC2 instances, however, these instances are only needed until the backlog is reduced.\nIn this scenario, which type of Amazon EC2 instance is the most cost-effective type to use?",
