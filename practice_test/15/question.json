Strict security policy mandates that the production VPC must only allow outbound communication over IPv6 between the instance and the internet but should prevent the internet from initiating an inbound IPv6 connection. The new architecture should also allow traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
