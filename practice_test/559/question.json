Currently, the container instances are run behind an Application Load Balancer, and CloudWatch alarms are configured to send notifications to the operations team if there is a problem in availability so they can scale out if needed. A solutions architect needs to create an automatic scaling solution when such problems occur.\nWhich solution could satisfy the requirement?",
