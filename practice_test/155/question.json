    "text": "A media company is setting up an ECS batch architecture for its image processing application. It will be hosted in an Amazon ECS Cluster with two ECS tasks that will handle image uploads from the users and image processing. The first ECS task will process the user requests, store the image in an S3 input bucket, and push a message to a queue. The second task reads from the queue, parses the message containing the object name, and then downloads the object. Once the image is processed and transformed, it will upload the objects to the S3 output bucket. To complete the architecture, the Solutions Architect must create a queue and the necessary IAM permissions for the ECS tasks.\nWhich of the following should the Architect do next?",
