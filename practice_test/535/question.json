Since the monitoring system requires a low network latency and high network throughput, the Architect decided to launch the EC2 instances to a new cluster placement group. The system was working fine for a couple of weeks, however, when they try to add new instances to the placement group that already has running EC2 instances, they receive an 'insufficient capacity error'.\nHow will the Architect fix this issue?",
