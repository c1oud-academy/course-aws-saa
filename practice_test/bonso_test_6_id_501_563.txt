A multinational corporate and investment bank is regularly processing steady workloads of accruals, loan interests, and other critical financial calculations every night from 10 PM to 3 AM on their on-premises data center for their corporate clients. Once the process is done, the results are then uploaded to the Oracle General Ledger which means that the processing should not be delayed or interrupted.
