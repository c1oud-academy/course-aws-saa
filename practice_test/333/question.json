    "text": "A company has a two-tier environment in its on-premises data center which is composed of an application tier and database tier. You are instructed to migrate their environment to the AWS cloud, and to design the subnets in their VPC with the following requirements:\n1. There is an application load balancer that would distribute the incoming traffic among the servers in the application tier.\n2. The application tier and the database tier must not be accessible from the public Internet. The application tier should only accept traffic coming from the load balancer.\n3. The database tier contains very sensitive data. It must not share the same subnet with other AWS resources and its custom route table with other instances in the environment.\n4. The environment must be highly available and scalable to handle a surge of incoming traffic over the Internet.\nHow many subnets should you create to meet the above requirements?",
