    "text": "A startup is building a microservices architecture in which the software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. In building large-scale systems, fine-grained decoupling of microservices is a recommended practice to implement. The decoupled services should scale horizontally from each other to improve scalability.\nWhat is the difference between Horizontal scaling and Vertical scaling?",
