    "text": "A company has several microservices that send messages to an Amazon SQS queue and a backend application that poll the queue to process the messages. The company also has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which defines the acceptable amount of time that can elapse from the point when the messages are received until a response is sent. The backend operations are I/O-intensive as the number of messages is constantly growing, causing the company to miss its SLA. The Solutions Architect must implement a new architecture that improves the application's processing time and load management.\nWhich of the following is the MOST effective solution that can satisfy the given requirement?"
