    "text": "A Solutions Architect is working for a multinational telecommunications company. The IT Manager wants to consolidate their log streams including the access, application, and security logs in one single system. Once consolidated, the company will analyze these logs in real-time based on heuristics. There will be some time in the future where the company will need to validate heuristics, which requires going back to data samples extracted from the last 12 hours.\nWhat is the best approach to meet this requirement?"
