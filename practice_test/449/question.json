    "text": "A company has an application hosted in an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer. There are several occasions where some instances are automatically terminated after failing the HTTPS health checks in the ALB and then purges all the ephemeral logs stored in the instance. A Solutions Architect must implement a solution that collects all of the application and server logs effectively. She should be able to perform a root cause analysis based on the logs, even if the Auto Scaling group immediately terminated the instance.\nWhat is the EASIEST way for the Architect to automate the log collection from the Amazon EC2 instances?"
